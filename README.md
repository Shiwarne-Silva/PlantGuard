# 🌿 **Plant Guard - AI-Powered Plant Disease Detection**

## 📌 **Project Overview**
Plant Guard is an AI-driven mobile and web application designed for **early detection and diagnosis of potato plant diseases** using deep learning. The system utilizes **image recognition** and **machine learning** to classify diseases such as **Early Blight** and **Late Blight** from uploaded plant leaf images. It provides **accurate diagnosis** along with **recommended treatments** to help farmers take immediate preventive action.


## 🔍 **Key Features**
- ✅ **AI-Powered Image Analysis** - Utilizes a trained **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model.
- ✅ **Fast & Accurate Diagnosis** - Predicts plant diseases with **high confidence scores**.
- ✅ **Treatment Recommendations** - Provides effective treatment suggestions for diagnosed diseases.
- ✅ **Mobile & Web Compatibility** - Available as a **mobile app (React Native)** and **web platform (React.js)**.
- ✅ **User-Friendly Interface** - Simple image upload and **instant analysis results**.


## 🛠 **Tech Stack**
### **Backend**
- 🚀 **FastAPI** - Lightweight, high-performance API framework.
- 🔬 **TensorFlow/Keras** - Machine learning model for disease classification.
- 🌐 **Uvicorn** - ASGI server for running FastAPI applications.

### **Frontend**
- 📱 **React Native** - Cross-platform mobile app development.
- 💻 **React.js** - Web interface for desktop users.
- 🔄 **Axios** - API communication between frontend and backend.

### **Machine Learning**
- 🧠 **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** - For image classification.
- 📊 **Pretrained model trained on PlantVillage dataset**.
- 🎯 **Performance Metrics** - Accuracy, F1 Score, Confusion Matrix.

### **Deployment**
- ⚡ **Local server** (Uvicorn) with API hosting.
- ☁️ **Future Scope**: Cloud-based deployment for scalability.


## 🚀 **How It Works**
1️⃣ The user **selects or captures** an image of a plant leaf.  
2️⃣ The image is **uploaded** to the FastAPI backend for processing.  
3️⃣ The CNN model **predicts the disease class** and confidence level.  
4️⃣ The system **returns a diagnosis** and recommended treatment.  


## 🧪 **Testing & Evaluation**
- ✅ **Functional Testing** - Ensures API endpoints and UI work as expected.
- ✅ **Performance Testing** - Evaluates speed, response time, and scalability.
- ✅ **Model Testing** - Uses accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for evaluation.


## 📌 **Future Enhancements**
- ☁️ **Cloud Deployment** - Migrate to cloud services for better scalability.
- 🌱 **Support for More Plants** - Expand database to detect diseases in other crops.
- 📴 **Offline Mode** - Allow AI-based diagnosis without internet connectivity.
